# Privacy Settings

Privacy settings can be found at [Settings > Privacy](hydra://settings/privacy).

## Error Reporting

When enabled, Hydra automatically sends an error log if it encounters a crash or loading issue. These logs include a stack trace to pinpoint the issue, your Reddit username (if logged in), and device details like phone model and available RAM. Error reports help keep Hydra bug-free.

Error reporting is enabled by default. To change this setting, go to [Privacy settings](hydra://settings/privacy) and toggle **"Allow Hydra to report errors"**. Hydra must be restarted for this change to take effect.

## What Hydra Collects

Outside of error reports, Hydra does not send your data to any external servers. Your Reddit content, browsing history, search queries, and personal information are never collected by Hydra. Reddit account credentials are stored securely on your device and are used solely to authenticate with Reddit directly.

If you use the [Stats](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=stats) feature (Hydra Pro), all statistics are stored locally on your device and are never uploaded to any server.

## Privacy Policy

You can read Hydra's full privacy policy by going to [Settings > General > Legal](hydra://settings/general/legal) and tapping **"Privacy Policy"**.
