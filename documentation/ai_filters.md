# AI-Powered Smart Filters

AI filters use machine learning to understand the meaning of posts and filter them based on a written description rather than just keywords. This allows for much more intelligent filtering that can catch unwanted content even when specific keywords aren't present. AI filters are a **Hydra Pro** feature.

## How AI Filters Work

When you set up an AI filter, Hydra sends the title, subreddit name, and text of each post to an AI service, which determines whether the post matches your filter description. Posts that match are automatically hidden from your feed.

AI filters analyze text only — they cannot scan images or videos. If unwanted content appears only in an image with no indication in the post title or text, the filter may miss it. AI filters apply to posts in your main feeds and subreddits, but do not apply to search results, user profiles, or gallery mode.

## Setting Up AI Filters

1. Go to [Filters settings](hydra://settings/general/filters)
2. Find the **"Smart Post Filter"** section
3. Enter a description of the content you want to filter, or select a preset

Write a clear description of the kinds of posts you want hidden. Be specific and include examples for best results.

**Example:**
```
Don't show posts about politics, elections, or political figures.
Hide content related to sports betting or gambling.
```

You can also start from a preset and edit it to better fit your needs. Selecting a preset replaces whatever is currently in the filter box.

## Filter Presets

Hydra includes several pre-configured filter presets. Tap a preset to apply it.

### No Politics

Filters posts about politics, economics in a political context, negative company mentions, billionaires, political subreddits, government agencies and figures, government buildings, hot political topics (abortion, gun control, etc.), negative environmental content, and content about ethnicity, gender, race, or religion.

### No Negativity

Filters posts that are negative or critical of people, companies, or products. Also catches angry rants, overly dramatic or emotional content, negative environmental content, and content that attempts to incite anger or outrage.

### No Graphic Content

Filters posts containing violence, blood, injuries, death, war, disaster footage, animal cruelty or hunting content, explicit sexual content or nudity, psychological horror or disturbing content, true crime details, medical emergencies, and paranormal or supernatural content.

### No Gambling Triggers

Filters posts about gambling, betting, sports betting, fantasy sports, casino games, lotteries, scratch cards, gambling promotions and communities, stock market and crypto trading, trading communities (e.g., WallStreetBets), market speculation, and trading terminology like "moon", "hodl", and "diamond hands".

### No Drugs and Alcohol

Filters posts about illegal drugs, drug culture, drug names and slang, alcohol brands and drinking stories, prescription drug abuse, drug-related communities and news, drug-related locations and events, and recovery or addiction content.

### No Fluff

Filters posts containing celebrity news and gossip, clickbait or sensational headlines, low-effort memes or reposts, poorly formatted content, made-up or exaggerated stories, personal drama, and story-based subreddits with common templates.

## Tips for Effective Filtering

- **Be specific** — More detailed descriptions produce better results.
- **Start with a preset** — Customize from there to match your preferences.
- **Test and refine** — Browse your feed after setting a filter and adjust as needed.
- **Combine with text filters** — Use AI filters alongside keyword-based text filters for the best coverage.

## Troubleshooting

If AI filters aren't working, verify that you have an active Hydra Pro subscription and that your filter description is not empty. AI filters require an internet connection.

If too much content is being filtered, simplify your filter description or write a more specific one. If too little is being filtered, add more detail or examples to your description.

Heavy filtering may slow down feed loading, since Hydra needs to load and evaluate more posts to fill your feed.
