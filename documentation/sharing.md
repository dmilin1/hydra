# Sharing

Hydra uses the native iOS share sheet to share Reddit content with other apps. You can share posts, comments, images, videos, and subreddit links.

## What Gets Shared

**Posts and comments** are shared as direct Reddit links. **Images** are shared as image files, and **videos** are downloaded and shared as video files. **Subreddits and multireddits** are shared as links to the subreddit page.

## Ways to Share

**Long press** on a post or comment to open the context menu, then select **Share**.

**Swipe** on a post or comment to share instantly, if you've assigned Share to a swipe direction in [Gestures settings](hydra://settings/general/gestures).

On a post's detail page, tap the **share button** in the action bar.

On a subreddit, multireddit, or post detail page, tap the **three-dot menu** and select **Share** to share the current page link.

**Long press on an image or video** to share the media directly.

In full-screen gallery view, use the **share button** in the post overlay to share the image or video.

## Shared links are public

When you share a post or comment link, only the link is included — your Reddit account information is never part of the shared content.
