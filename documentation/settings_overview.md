# Settings Overview

Hydra's settings are organized into categories, making it easy to find and configure the features you want. Access settings by tapping the **Settings** tab in the bottom tab bar. You can use the **search bar** at the top to ask a question or search for a specific setting.

## Settings Categories

### General

General settings cover core functionality including swipe gestures, post and comment sorting preferences, content filters, link handling, app startup behavior, external link browser selection, and legal information.

### Data Use

Enable low data mode separately for Wi-Fi and cellular connections. When enabled, videos only load on tap, article images are skipped, and subreddit icons are not loaded.

### Stats

View your usage statistics including Reddit activity, favorite communities, and achievements. Stats is a Pro feature — non-subscribers can preview the page but data is obfuscated.

### Privacy

Control whether Hydra sends error reports when it encounters a crash or loading issue. Error logs include a stack trace, your Reddit username (if logged in), and device details. This setting requires an app restart to take effect.

### Advanced
