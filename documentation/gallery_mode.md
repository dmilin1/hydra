# Gallery Mode

Gallery Mode transforms your feed into a media-focused grid, filtering out text-only posts and displaying images and videos in a two-column masonry layout. It's ideal for browsing visual content quickly and efficiently.

## Opening Gallery Mode

To open Gallery Mode, tap the **"..."** menu button in the top-right corner and select **"Open in Gallery Mode"**. This option is available on subreddit pages, the home feed, and multireddit pages.

Hydra may also suggest Gallery Mode automatically if it detects that a feed is mostly images and videos.

## Browsing and Viewing

Scroll vertically through the grid to browse media. Tap any image or video to open it in full-screen.

In full-screen view:

- **Swipe left/right** to move between images within the same post (for multi-image posts)
- **Swipe up/down** to move between different posts
- **Pinch** to zoom in on images
- **Tap** the screen to show or hide the post overlay
- **Swipe down** from the top or tap the **X** button to close

The post overlay shows the title, a text preview, the subreddit, and the author. Tapping the overlay opens the full post. You can also share the image or video directly using the share button.

## Filters

Gallery Mode automatically filters out non-media posts. Your text filters and "hide seen posts" settings still apply. On multireddit pages, subreddit filters are also applied.

Note that AI filters do not apply in Gallery Mode.

## Unlimited Scrolling (Pro)

Free users can browse up to 100 posts in Gallery Mode. **Hydra Pro** removes this limit, allowing unlimited scrolling. To unlock this, [subscribe to Hydra Pro](hydra://settings/hydraPro).

## Troubleshooting

- **Gallery Mode not showing content** - Your filters may be too strict, or the feed may not have enough media posts. Try loosening your filters or switching to a more visual feed.
- **Slow loading** - Check your internet connection. You can also clear the image cache in [Advanced settings](hydra://settings/advanced).
- **Media not displaying** - The content may have been deleted or removed from Reddit. Try refreshing the gallery.
