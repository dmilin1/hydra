# App Icons

Hydra supports alternate app icons, allowing you to customize how the app appears on your home screen. You can choose from a selection of community-created icons or stick with the default.

## Device Support

The App Icon option only appears in settings if your device supports alternate icons. This is detected automatically — if you don't see the option, your device or OS version doesn't support it.

## Changing Your App Icon

1. Go to [App Icon settings](hydra://settings/appIcon)
2. Tap on an icon to view its details and creator info
3. Tap **Set as App Icon** to apply it

The change takes effect immediately on your home screen. A checkmark badge indicates which icon is currently active.

Each icon has a detail page showing the creator's profile, bio, and links to their Reddit, website, or Instagram where available.

## Troubleshooting

If the **App Icon** option doesn't appear in settings, your device may not support alternate icons. Try updating your device's operating system.

If an icon fails to apply, try selecting it again. In rare cases, a device restart may be needed.
