# Accounts and Login

Hydra allows you to manage multiple Reddit accounts and easily switch between them. You can browse Reddit without an account, but logging in unlocks the ability to vote, comment, post, and access your personalized content.

When you are logged out, the center tab will display as an "Accounts" tab. When you are logged in, the center tab will display your username and take you to your user profile page.

## Logging In

### Creating a New Reddit Account

Hydra does not support creating Reddit accounts in-app. To create a new account:

1. Visit [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com) in a browser and sign up
2. Return to Hydra and log in using the steps below

### Logging In to an Existing Account

1. Go to the **Accounts** tab
2. Tap the **+** button in the top right corner
3. Reddit's login page will open — enter your username and password
4. Complete any two-factor authentication if enabled
5. You will be logged in and your account will be saved for future use

## Managing Multiple Accounts

### Adding Additional Accounts

1. Go to your user profile tab
2. Tap **Accounts** in the top left corner
3. Tap **+** in the top right corner
4. Log in with your second account credentials
5. Both accounts will be available for switching

### Switching Between Accounts

1. Go to your user profile tab
2. Tap **"Accounts"** in the top left corner
3. Tap the account you want to use
4. The app will log you in to that account

### Removing an Account

1. Go to your user profile tab
2. Tap **"Accounts"** in the top left corner
3. Swipe left on the account you want to remove and tap the **delete** icon or long press the account and select **"Delete"**

### Using Reddit logged out

1. Go to your user profile tab
2. Tap **"Accounts"** in the top left corner
3. Tap **"Logged Out"**
4. You will now be in logged out mode

## Browsing Without an Account

You can use Hydra without logging in to:

- Browse public subreddits
- View posts and comments
- Search Reddit
- Read content

However, you won't be able to interact with content (vote, comment, post) or access personalized features.

## Troubleshooting Login Issues

If you're having trouble logging in:

- **Check your credentials** - Make sure your username and password are correct
- **Two-factor authentication** - Complete 2FA if enabled on your account
- **Reddit status** - Check if Reddit is experiencing issues
- **Network connection** - Ensure you have a stable internet connection
- **Try logging in on Reddit.com** - Verify your account works in a browser first

## Security

- Hydra stores your session securely on your device using encrypted storage
- Your password is never sent to Hydra's servers — you log in directly through Reddit
- You can remove accounts at any time to clear stored session data
