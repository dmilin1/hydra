# Saving Posts and Comments

Saving lets you bookmark posts and comments to revisit later. Saved items are stored on your Reddit account, so they sync across all devices and Reddit clients.

## How to Save

**From a post detail page**, tap the bookmark icon in the bottom action bar. The icon fills in to indicate the post is saved.

**From a feed or comment thread**, long press a post or comment and select **"Save"** from the menu.

**With swipe gestures**, swipe on a post or comment to save it. By default, a long left swipe triggers save. You can change which swipe direction triggers save in [Gestures settings](hydra://settings/general/gestures).

A small bookmark notch appears on saved posts and comments so you can spot them as you scroll.

## Accessing Saved Content

Open the **Account** tab to view your profile. Two buttons appear on your profile page: **"Saved Posts"** and **"Saved Comments"**. Tap either one to browse your saved items. Saved content supports pull-to-refresh and infinite scrolling.

## Unsaving

To unsave a post or comment, use any of the same methods you used to save it — tap the bookmark icon again, long press and select **"Unsave"**, or swipe. The item is removed from your saved list immediately.

## Limitations

Saved content is a Reddit feature, so it inherits Reddit's limitations. There are no folders, tags, or search within saved items. You cannot sort or filter your saved list. Items saved in Hydra appear in any Reddit client, and vice versa.

## Troubleshooting

If you can't save items, make sure you are logged in and have an active internet connection. If saved items appear to be missing, check that you are on the correct account — the item may also have been deleted by its author.
