# Hydra Pro

Hydra Pro is a monthly subscription that unlocks advanced features and helps support Hydra's ongoing development. Your subscription directly helps cover server and API costs, keeping Hydra alive and improving.

## Pro Features

### Inbox Alerts

Push notifications for your Reddit inbox. Get notified instantly when you receive replies and messages so you never miss a conversation.

### Gallery Mode Unlimited Scrolling

Free users are limited to 100 items in Gallery Mode. Pro removes this limit, letting you scroll through entire subreddits without restriction.

### Stats Tracking

Track your Reddit activity with usage statistics, achievements, and fun facts. Free users see obfuscated numbers — Pro unlocks full, unobfuscated stats. Stats are only ever stored on device.

### Advanced Post Filtering

AI-powered smart filters that understand the meaning of content, not just keywords. Choose from built-in presets like "No Politics" or "No Negativity," or write your own custom filter descriptions.

### Post & Comment Summaries

AI-generated summaries for long posts and comment sections. Post summaries appear below the post content, and comment summaries give you an overview of the discussion — so you can get the key points at a glance.
