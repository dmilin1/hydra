# Themes

Themes change Hydra's color scheme, including backgrounds, text, icons, buttons, and action colors. You can choose from built-in themes, create your own, or import themes shared by the community.

## Built-in Themes

Hydra includes 12 built-in themes. Seven are free and five require [Hydra Pro](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=hydra_pro).

### Free Themes

- **Dark** — Default dark theme with a black background
- **Light** — Default light theme with a white background
- **Midnight** — Dark gray background
- **Discord** — Inspired by Discord's dark color scheme
- **Spotify** — Inspired by Spotify's dark color scheme with green accents
- **Strawberry** — Light pink theme
- **Spiderman** — Dark blue and red theme

### Pro Themes

- **Gilded** — Dark theme with gold accents
- **Mulberry** — Dark theme with pink accents
- **Deep Ocean** — Deep blue theme with cyan accents
- **Aurora** — Dark theme with green/cyan accents
- **Royal** — Dark purple theme

Free users can preview Pro themes for 5 minutes before they revert to the default theme.

## Selecting a Theme

Go to [Theme settings](hydra://settings/theme) and tap any theme to apply it. Changes take effect immediately and persist across app sessions.

## Different Dark Mode Theme

By default, Hydra uses a single theme at all times. Enabling **"Different Dark Mode Theme"** in [Theme settings](hydra://settings/theme) lets you assign separate themes for light and dark mode. The app automatically switches between them based on your device's system appearance setting.

When enabled, **Light** and **Dark** buttons appear at the top of the theme list so you can configure each mode's theme independently.

## Community Themes

You can browse themes shared by other users at [r/HydraThemes](https://reddit.com/r/HydraThemes). When viewing a post or comment that contains an embedded theme, Hydra automatically detects it and displays a preview card. Tap the card to import the theme.

You can also share your own custom themes by embedding them in posts or comments. See [Creating Custom Themes](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=custom_themes) for details on creating, sharing, and importing themes.

## Custom Themes

The Theme Maker lets you create fully custom themes with control over 19 color properties. Tap **"Custom Theme +"** in [Theme settings](hydra://settings/theme) to get started. The Theme Maker is a [Hydra Pro](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=hydra_pro) feature, though free users can try it for 5 minutes.

For full details, see [Creating Custom Themes](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=custom_themes).
