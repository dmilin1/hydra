# Hiding Content

Hydra offers several ways to hide content from your feeds. Filters apply to posts in the main feeds and subreddits, but do not apply to search results or user profiles. Excessive filtering may make load times slower because more posts have to be loaded before showing results.

## Hide Seen Posts

When enabled, posts you've already viewed are automatically hidden from your feed so you only see new content. To enable it, go to [Filters settings](hydra://settings/general/filters) and toggle **"Hide Seen Posts"**.

Posts are marked as seen when you open them, vote on them, comment on them, or scroll past them (if "Mark as Seen On Scroll" is enabled). You can also manually mark a post by long-pressing it and selecting **"Mark as Read"**.

## Mark as Seen On Scroll

This setting automatically marks posts as seen as you scroll past them, without needing to open each one. When combined with "Hide Seen Posts", posts are hidden as soon as you scroll past.

To enable it, go to [Filters settings](hydra://settings/general/filters) and toggle **"Mark as Seen On Scroll"**. You will need to restart the app for this change to take effect.

## Subreddit-Specific Overrides

You can override the global "Hide Seen Posts" setting for individual pages. For example, if you have "Hide Seen Posts" enabled globally, you can choose to show seen posts on a specific subreddit, or vice versa.

To toggle this, open the context menu (three dots) on any feed page and select **"Show Seen Posts"** or **"Hide Seen Posts"**. Pages with overrides are listed in [Filters settings](hydra://settings/general/filters).

## Filtering Subreddits

You can hide all posts from specific subreddits. Subreddit filters apply on combined feeds such as the home feed, r/all, r/popular, and multireddits. They do not apply when browsing an individual subreddit directly.

To filter a subreddit, long-press a post from that subreddit and select **"Filter Subreddit"**. The post is removed and all future posts from that subreddit are hidden.

To manage your filtered subreddits, go to [Filters settings](hydra://settings/general/filters) and scroll to the **"Filtered subreddits"** section. Tap a subreddit and confirm to remove the filter.

## Text Filters and Smart Filters

Beyond the options above, Hydra also supports keyword-based text filters and AI-powered smart filters for more granular control over what appears in your feed. These are configured in [Filters settings](hydra://settings/general/filters).

For details, see [Text Filters](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=text_filters) and [AI Filters](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=ai_filters).
