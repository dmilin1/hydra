# Browsing Posts

## Viewing Your Feed

Your home feed shows posts from subscribed subreddits. Open the Posts tab to see your feed. Posts load automatically as you scroll, and you can pull down to refresh at any time. Earlier posts remain accessible when scrolling back up. Enable compact mode in [Appearance settings](hydra://settings/appearance) for a denser layout showing more posts at once.

## Opening Post Details

Tap any post card to open it in detail view. Scroll down to see comments, then swipe right or tap back to return. Post details include full content, author info, subreddit name, media, vote counts, comments, and post actions. By default, tapping on the post content area collapses it — you can disable this with the "Tap to Collapse" toggle in [Appearance settings](hydra://settings/appearance).

## Post Interactions

Tap to open post details, swipe for quick actions (configure in [Gestures settings](hydra://settings/general/gestures)), long press for additional options, vote directly from the feed, or save posts for later.

## Post Types

Hydra supports the following post types:

- **Text posts** — Self-posts with configurable preview length
- **Link posts** — External links with previews
- **Image posts** — Inline images with gallery support
- **Video posts** — Embedded players with optional auto-play
- **Poll posts** — Interactive polls
- **Crossposts** — Shows the original post and subreddit

NSFW and spoiler content is blurred by default. Tap to reveal, or configure in [Appearance settings](hydra://settings/appearance).

## Post Information

Each post displays its title, subreddit, author, time posted, vote count, comment count, and flair (if enabled).

## Filtering and Sorting

Sort posts by Best, Hot, New, Top (with time periods), or Rising. Configure defaults in [Sorting settings](hydra://settings/general/sorting).

Filter posts using text filters, AI filters (Pro), hide seen posts, or subreddit filters. Learn more in the [Filtering guide](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=text_filters).

## Marking Posts as Seen

Hydra marks posts as seen when you open them or interact with their media. You can also enable "Mark as Seen On Scroll" to mark posts as you scroll past them. Seen posts appear dimmed in the feed. Enable "Hide Seen Posts" to automatically filter them out. Configure in [Filters settings](hydra://settings/general/filters).

## Gallery Mode

For image-heavy subreddits, Hydra offers a gallery mode that displays media in a grid layout. Open it from the context menu on any subreddit page. Learn more in the [Gallery Mode guide](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=gallery_mode).

## Troubleshooting

If posts aren't loading, check your internet connection and pull down to refresh. If posts seem missing, check whether your filters are hiding content or try a different sort option.
