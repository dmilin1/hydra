# Gestures and Swipe Actions

Hydra's gesture system lets you interact with posts and comments using swipe gestures. Configure four swipe directions per item type: short right, long right, short left, and long left.

## Swipe Anywhere to Navigate

Enable "Swipe Anywhere to Navigate" in [Gestures settings](hydra://settings/general/gestures) to swipe right from anywhere on the screen to go back. When enabled, right swipe actions are disabled — only left swipe actions remain active.

## Post Swipe Actions

Configure four swipe actions for posts in [Gestures settings](hydra://settings/general/gestures). Available actions: Upvote, Downvote, Mark as Read, Bookmark, Share.

Default configuration: Short Right (Upvote), Long Right (Downvote), Short Left (Mark as Read), Long Left (Bookmark).

## Comment Swipe Actions

Configure four swipe actions for comments in [Gestures settings](hydra://settings/general/gestures). Available actions: Upvote, Downvote, Reply, Bookmark, Share, Collapse, Collapse Thread.

Default configuration: Short Right (Upvote), Long Right (Downvote), Short Left (Reply), Long Left (Bookmark).

## Gesture Actions

**Upvote/Downvote**: Vote on posts or comments without opening them. Swipe again to undo your vote.

**Mark as Read** (posts only): Marks posts as read and hides them from your feed. Works with the "Hide seen posts" filter.

**Bookmark**: Save posts or comments for later access.

**Share**: Opens the share sheet directly without opening any menus.

**Reply** (comments only): Opens the reply composer immediately.

**Collapse/Collapse Thread** (comments only): Collapse hides a single comment, while Collapse Thread collapses the entire thread.

## Gesture Feedback

When swiping, colored backgrounds and action icons indicate which action will trigger. Short and long swipe distances correspond to the two actions configured for that direction.
