# Subreddits

## Subreddits Page

The Subreddits page is your starting point for navigating communities. It is the first screen in the Posts tab — swipe back from your Home feed to return to it. The page is organized into sections:

- **Home** — posts from your subscriptions
- **Popular** — popular posts across Reddit
- **All** — posts from all subreddits
- **Favorites** — your favorited subreddits
- **Multireddits** — your custom feeds
- **Moderator** — subreddits you moderate
- **Subscribed** — all subscribed subreddits, sorted alphabetically

An A-Z scroller on the right side lets you quickly jump to subreddits by their first letter. When not logged in, trending subreddits are shown instead of subscriptions.

## Browsing a Subreddit

Tap a subreddit name anywhere in the app to open it. You can also use the Search tab to find subreddits by name or topic, or enter a URL directly. When viewing a subreddit, you'll see its posts with a search bar at the top for searching within that subreddit. Use the sort button to change post ordering (Best, Hot, New, Top, Rising).

The three-dot menu (...) provides additional options including Subscribe/Unsubscribe, Favorite/Unfavorite, Add to Multireddit, New Post, Open in Gallery Mode, Sidebar, Wiki, and Share.

## Subscribing

Open a subreddit, tap the three-dot menu (...), and select "Subscribe" to add it to your subscriptions. Posts from subscribed subreddits appear in your Home feed. To unsubscribe, open the same menu and select "Unsubscribe." Your subscriptions appear in the Subscribed section of the Subreddits page.

## Favorites

Favorite a subreddit to pin it to the top of your Subreddits page for quick access. You can favorite a subreddit by tapping the star icon next to it on the Subreddits page, or by selecting "Favorite" from the three-dot menu when viewing a subreddit. You must be subscribed to a subreddit before you can favorite it. Favorites are stored locally on your device.

## Multireddits

Multireddits group multiple subreddits into a single combined feed. They appear in the Multireddits section of the Subreddits page. Tap a multireddit to browse its combined feed, or tap the chevron to expand it and see which subreddits it contains.

To add a subreddit to an existing multireddit, open the subreddit's three-dot menu and select "Add to Multireddit." To remove a subreddit, expand the multireddit on the Subreddits page, long-press the subreddit, and select "Delete From Multireddit." Multireddits must be created on Reddit's website — they cannot be created within Hydra.

## Filtering Subreddits

Long-press a post from a subreddit you want to hide and select "Filter Subreddit." This hides posts from that subreddit in combined feeds (Home, Popular, All, and multireddits) but does not apply when browsing a subreddit directly. Manage your filtered subreddits in [Filters settings](hydra://settings/general/filters).

## Gallery Mode

For media-heavy subreddits, tap the three-dot menu and select "Open in Gallery Mode" to browse images and videos in a grid layout. Pro users can scroll more than 100 items deep. Learn more in the [Gallery Mode guide](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=gallery_mode).

## Subreddit Info

To view a subreddit's description, subscriber count, and rules, tap the three-dot menu and select "Sidebar." Rules are expandable — tap a rule to see its full description. You can also access a subreddit's wiki from the three-dot menu.

## Settings

- **Subreddit at top** — displays the subreddit name prominently on posts. Configure in [Appearance settings](hydra://settings/appearance).
- **Subreddit icons** — shows community icons next to subreddit names. Configure in [Appearance settings](hydra://settings/appearance).
- **Remember sort per subreddit** — remembers your last sort choice for each subreddit. Configure in [Sorting settings](hydra://settings/general/sorting).
