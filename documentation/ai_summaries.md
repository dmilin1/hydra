# AI Summaries

AI Summaries is a [Hydra Pro](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=hydra_pro) feature that generates concise summaries of posts and comments, helping you quickly understand long content without reading everything.

## Post Summaries

Post summaries provide a brief overview of long text posts. When you open a post, a summary appears below the post content in a bordered box labeled **"Summary."** Summaries are only generated for text posts that are long enough to benefit from one — short posts won't show a summary.

To toggle post summaries, go to [Appearance settings](hydra://settings/appearance) and find **"Show post summary"** under **Post Appearance Settings**. This setting is enabled by default for Pro users.

## Comment Summaries

Comment summaries provide an overview of the discussion by summarizing the top comments on a post. The summary appears between the post content and the comment section, labeled **"Comments Summary."** It is only generated when there is enough comment text to meaningfully summarize.

You can tap the comment summary to collapse or expand it.

To toggle comment summaries, go to [Appearance settings](hydra://settings/appearance) and find **"Show comment summary"** under **Comment Appearance Settings**. This setting is enabled by default for Pro users.

## How Summaries Work

When you open a post, Hydra sends the content to its server, which uses AI to generate a summary. Summaries are generated each time you open a post and are not cached.

If both post and comment summaries are enabled, the post summary is generated first. The comment summary is then generated with the post summary as additional context, resulting in a more relevant overview of the discussion.

## Troubleshooting

If summaries are not appearing:

- Verify you have an active [Hydra Pro](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=hydra_pro) subscription
- Check that summaries are enabled in [Appearance settings](hydra://settings/appearance)
- Make sure you have an internet connection
- Summaries only appear for content that is long enough to benefit from one
