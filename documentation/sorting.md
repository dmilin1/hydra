# Sorting Posts and Comments

## Post Sorting Options

**Best**: Reddit's algorithm showing most relevant content, personalized based on your activity.

**Hot**: Currently trending posts based on recent engagement, time-weighted.

**New**: Most recently posted content, chronological order.

**Top**: Highest voted posts. Time periods: Hour, Day, Week, Month, Year, All Time.

**Rising**: Posts gaining momentum, based on vote velocity.

Multireddits have a slightly different set of sort options: Hot, New, Top, Rising, and Controversial.

## Comment Sorting Options

**Best**: Reddit's algorithm showing most relevant comments.

**New**: Most recent comments, chronological.

**Top**: Highest voted comments.

**Controversial**: Comments with mixed votes, often divisive.

**Old**: Oldest comments first, original order.

**Q&A**: Organizes comments as questions and answers, useful for Q&A posts.

## Changing Sort

Tap the sort icon in the top-right while browsing to change sort. For posts, selecting "Top" will prompt you to choose a time period. Changes apply immediately and are remembered if per-subreddit memory is enabled.

## Default Sorting

Set default post and comment sorts in [Sorting settings](hydra://settings/general/sorting). If "Top" is selected for posts, you can also set the default time period. Enable "Apply sort to home" to apply your default sort to the home feed.

## Remembering Per-Subreddit Sorts

Enable "Remember subreddit sort" for posts and comments separately to have Hydra save each subreddit's last used sort. Use "Clear custom sorts" to reset all remembered sorts.
