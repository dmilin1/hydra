# Live Text

Live Text is an iOS feature that lets you interact with text found in images. When enabled in Hydra, you can select, copy, translate, and look up text directly from image posts.

## Requirements

Live Text requires iOS 15 or newer on a device with an A12 chip or later. It must also be enabled in your device's iOS Settings (it's usually on by default). Live Text is not available on Android.

## Enabling Live Text

Live Text is disabled by default because it interferes with image long press gestures. To enable it:

1. Go to [Appearance settings](hydra://settings/appearance)
2. Under **"Post Appearance Settings"**, enable **"Live text"**

## Using Live Text

When viewing an image that contains text, tap and hold on the text to highlight it. From there you can select, copy, translate, look up, search, or share the recognized text — just like selecting text anywhere else in iOS.

**Note:** With Live Text enabled, the long press gesture to open the context menu requires a longer hold to avoid conflicts with text selection.

## Limitations

Live Text may not work well with low-resolution images, very small text, unusual fonts, or complex layouts. Handwriting recognition is limited. Recognition accuracy depends on image quality.

## Troubleshooting

If Live Text isn't working:

- Ensure your device meets the requirements (iOS 15+, A12 chip or newer)
- Check that Live Text is enabled in both Hydra and your device's iOS Settings
- Try a different image — some images may not contain recognizable text
