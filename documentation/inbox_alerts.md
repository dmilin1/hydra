# Inbox Alerts

Inbox Alerts is a [Hydra Pro](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=hydra_pro) feature that sends you push notifications when you receive new comment replies, post replies, or private messages. This lets you stay connected to Reddit discussions without having to open the app to check.

## Setup

Inbox Alerts are enabled by default for Hydra Pro subscribers. When you first subscribe to Pro, the app will ask you to grant notification permission. Once granted, you'll start receiving push notifications automatically.

If you previously denied the notification prompt, you can enable notifications manually:

1. Open the **iOS Settings** app
2. Find **Hydra** in the app list
3. Tap **Notifications**
4. Toggle notifications **on**

## What You'll Be Notified About

You'll receive push notifications for new items in your inbox:

- **Comment replies** - When someone replies to your comments
- **Post replies** - When someone comments on your posts

Tapping a notification opens Hydra directly to the relevant content. The app icon badge also updates to show your current unread count.

## Managing Notifications

Since Inbox Alerts use the iOS notification system, you can manage them through **iOS Settings > Hydra > Notifications**. From there you can control sounds, banners, badges, and lock screen appearance.

Inbox Alerts also respect **Do Not Disturb** and **Focus modes**, so you can schedule quiet hours or limit notifications to specific times.

To stop receiving Inbox Alerts entirely, you can disable notifications for Hydra in iOS Settings.

## Troubleshooting

If you're not receiving notifications:

- **Check your Pro status** - Inbox Alerts require an active Hydra Pro subscription
- **Check iOS permissions** - Make sure notifications are enabled for Hydra in iOS Settings
- **Check Do Not Disturb** - Notifications may be silenced by a Focus mode
- **Check your connection** - The app needs internet access to register for notifications
- **Restart the app** - This re-registers your device for push notifications
