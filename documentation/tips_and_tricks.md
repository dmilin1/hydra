# Tips and Tricks

These are lesser-known features and techniques that can significantly improve your Hydra experience. For basic usage, see [Getting Started](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=getting_started).

## Hidden Gestures and Interactions

**Tap the active tab** to go back one level in the navigation stack, instead of reaching for the back button.

**Long press the Search tab** to instantly open a quick subreddit search overlay. This is faster than navigating to the Search tab and typing — just long press, type at least 3 characters, and jump straight to a subreddit.

**Long press** on posts, comments, images, videos, subreddits, and users to access context menus with quick actions like save, share, copy, reply, and more.

**Swipe Anywhere to Navigate** lets you swipe right from anywhere on the screen to go back. Enable it in [Gestures settings](hydra://settings/general/gestures). Note that enabling this disables right swipe actions — only left swipe actions remain active.

## Scroll to Next Comment Button

When viewing a post's comments, a floating button appears to help you navigate between top-level comments. Tap the button to jump to the next top-level comment, or long press it to jump to the previous one.

You can reposition this button by holding it for about a second until move mode activates — a dark overlay with snap points will appear. Drag the button to any snap point and release to save its new position.

## Image Viewer

**Double-tap** an image in full-screen view to zoom in (2x). Double-tap again to zoom back out. You can also **pinch to zoom** and pan around when zoomed in. **Swipe down** to close the full-screen image viewer.

For multi-image posts, swipe left and right to browse between images. An indicator shows which image you're viewing (e.g., "2 of 5").

**Long press** any image to save it to your photo library or share it.

**Live Text** (iOS 16+) lets you select, copy, and look up text found in images. Enable it in [Appearance settings](hydra://settings/appearance).

## Video Player

**Tap the playback speed button** (top-left corner in full-screen video) to cycle through 0.5x, 1x, 1.5x, and 2x playback speeds.

**Drag horizontally** on a video to scrub through it. Videos also support **Picture-in-Picture** on iOS — use the system PiP gesture to keep watching while you browse.

**Long press** a video for options to save or share it. To download a video to your device, long press it, tap **"Share"**, then select **"Save Video"** from the share sheet. See the [Sharing guide](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=sharing) for more details.

## Gallery Mode

Open Gallery Mode from the "..." menu on any subreddit or feed page. It shows a two-column masonry grid of media posts, filtering out text-only content. Hydra will also suggest Gallery Mode automatically if it detects your feed is mostly images and videos.

In full-screen gallery view, swipe up and down to move between posts, and left and right to browse images within multi-image posts. Tap the screen to show or hide the post overlay, and tap the overlay to open the full post.

Gallery Mode is unlimited for Pro users. Free users can browse up to 100 posts.

## Drafts

Hydra automatically saves drafts as you compose posts, comments, and messages. If you accidentally close the editor or navigate away, your draft will be restored when you return. No action needed — it just works.

## Clipboard Link Detection

Enable "Read Links from Clipboard" in [Settings → General → Open in Hydra](hydra://settings/general/open-in-hydra) and Hydra will check your clipboard when the app opens. If it finds a Reddit link, it will offer to open it directly in Hydra.

## Keeping Your Feed Fresh

Enable **"Mark as Seen On Scroll"** and **"Hide Seen Posts"** together in [Settings](hydra://settings) to automatically clear posts you've already scrolled past. This keeps your feed fresh without any manual effort.

Combine this with **text filters** and **AI filters** (Pro) to remove unwanted content before you even see it. You can also filter entire subreddits from your feed. See [Text Filters](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=text_filters) and [AI Filters](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=ai_filters) for details.

## Pro Features Worth Knowing About

Several Pro features work quietly in the background once enabled:

- **AI Filters** — Automatically hide posts matching natural-language descriptions like "no politics" or "no negativity."
- **AI Summaries** — Get quick overviews of long posts and comment threads.
- **Stats** — Track your browsing activity, favorite communities, and achievements.
- **Inbox Alerts** — Receive push notifications for replies and messages.
- **Custom Themes** — Create and share your own color themes.

## Other Useful Tips

**Compact mode** in [Appearance settings](hydra://settings/appearance) shows more posts at once with a denser layout — great for quickly scanning a feed.

**Per-subreddit sort memory** saves your preferred sort for each subreddit, so you don't have to change it every time you visit. Configure default sorts in [Sorting settings](hydra://settings/general/sorting).

**Favorites** let you pin frequently visited subreddits to the top of your subreddit list. Long press a subreddit and select "Favorite," or manage them in the Subreddits tab.

**Multireddits** let you group related subreddits into combined feeds — useful for browsing by topic or interest. See [Organizing Feeds](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=organizing_feeds).

**Split View** (iPad only) shows posts side-by-side for a more efficient browsing experience. Enable it in [Appearance settings](hydra://settings/appearance).
