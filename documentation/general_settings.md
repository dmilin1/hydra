# General Settings

## Startup Settings

**Start Hydra on This Tab**: Choose which tab opens on launch. Options: Posts (default), Inbox, Account, Search, Settings. Configure in [Startup settings](hydra://settings/general/startup).

**Startup URL**: Open to a specific Reddit page on launch. Enter any valid Reddit URL (e.g., `https://www.reddit.com/r/technology`, `https://www.reddit.com/r/all/hot`). This overrides the initial tab setting. Invalid URLs display an error and are ignored. Configure in [Startup settings](hydra://settings/general/startup).

## Open in Hydra Settings

**Hydra Shortcut**: Adds "Open in Hydra" to iOS share sheets. Tap "Get Hydra Shortcut" in [Open in Hydra settings](hydra://settings/general/openInHydra) to install via the iOS Shortcuts app. Once installed, "Open in Hydra" appears in share menus from any app.

**Read Links from Clipboard**: Automatically detects Reddit links in your clipboard when the app opens and offers to open them. To avoid repeated permission prompts, go to iOS Settings > Hydra > "Paste from Other Apps" and set to "Allow".

Learn more in the [External Links guide](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=external_links).

## Legal Settings

Access Privacy Policy and End User License Agreement (EULA) links in [Legal settings](hydra://settings/general/legal). These open in your browser.

## External Links Settings

**Open Links With**: Choose which browser opens external links. Options: Hydra (built-in browser), Default Browser (usually Safari), Chrome, Brave, Firefox, Edge, Opera. Third-party browsers must be installed on your device. Configure in [External Links settings](hydra://settings/general/externalLinks).

**Open in Reader Mode**: When "Open links with" is set to "Hydra", this toggle appears and makes the built-in browser automatically open pages in reader mode for a cleaner reading experience. This setting is only visible when using Hydra's built-in browser.

Learn more in the [External Links guide](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=external_links).
