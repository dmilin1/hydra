# Usage Statistics

Stats is a [Hydra Pro](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=hydra_pro) feature that provides detailed analytics about your Reddit usage. Track your activity, explore your browsing patterns, and discover interesting insights about how you use Reddit.

## Pro Feature

Stats requires a **Hydra Pro** subscription. Free users can still visit the [Stats page](hydra://settings/stats) to see what's available, but all numbers will be replaced with asterisks. An informational prompt will offer the option to subscribe.

## Your Reddit Activity

The Stats page opens with "Your Hydra Journey" — a summary showing how long you've been using Hydra. Below that, you'll find cards for each of these activity categories:

- **Posts Explored** — Total number of posts you've viewed.
- **Distance Scrolled** — How far you've scrolled, shown in feet/meters or miles/kilometers depending on the distance. Also includes a fun banana comparison.
- **Upvotes Given** — Total upvotes, broken down by posts and comments.
- **Downvotes Given** — Total downvotes, broken down by posts and comments.
- **Content Created** — Total posts and comments you've made, with a breakdown of each.

## Usage Patterns

Below your activity cards, a usage patterns section shows:

- **App Launches** — How many times you've launched Hydra.
- **Opens per Day** — Average number of times you open Hydra per day.
- **Total Opens** — Total number of times Hydra has been brought to the foreground.
- **Upvote Ratio** — The percentage of your votes that are upvotes (only shown if you've voted).

## Favorite Communities

If you've visited any subreddits, the Stats page shows your **top 10 most visited communities**, ranked by visit count. Each subreddit displays a progress bar showing its relative activity compared to your most-visited community.

## Achievements

Achievements appear on your Stats page once you've unlocked them. There is no progress indicator — they simply appear when the condition is met.

- **Dedicated User** — Launched Hydra 50+ times.
- **Scroll Master** — Scrolled 5+ kilometers.
- **Positive Vibes** — 80%+ upvote ratio with at least 10 total votes.
- **Content Creator** — Created 10+ posts.
- **Commentary Master** — Created 10+ comments.
- **Explorer** — Visited 10+ unique communities.
- **Knowledge Seeker** — Viewed 100+ posts.

## Fun Facts

The Stats page generates personalized fun facts based on your activity. These are calculated dynamically and only appear when relevant. Examples include how many marathons you've scrolled, what percentage of the way to the moon you've scrolled, how many posts you read for every one you create, and your upvote-to-downvote ratio.

The page also recognizes special milestone numbers (like 69, 420, 1337, and others) across your stats, showing a playful message when you hit one.

## Privacy

All stats are stored **locally on your device** and are never sent to any servers. Only you can see your stats. The Stats page also includes a note thanking Hydra Pro subscribers for supporting the app.

## Troubleshooting

If your stats aren't showing, make sure you have an active Hydra Pro subscription. Stats are only tracked from your install date, so historical activity before installing Hydra won't be reflected. If numbers seem off, keep in mind that some values involve rounding and that tracking began no earlier than August 2025.
