# Creating Posts

## How to Create a Post

Navigate to a subreddit, open the context menu (three dots in the top right), and select **"New Post"**. The post creation screen has a post type selector, title field, content area, optional flair selector, and a **"Post"** button. The "New Post" option is only available when viewing a subreddit.

## Post Types

**Text Posts** include a title and a body written with Markdown. The editor includes a formatting toolbar and a **Preview** section below so you can see how your post will look before submitting.

**Link Posts** include a title and a URL. Enter the full link in the URL field.

**Image Posts** include a title and a single image. Tap **"Select Image"** to choose an image from your photo library. The image is uploaded automatically and a preview is shown before you submit. Multiple images are not currently supported.

## Formatting

Text posts use the same Markdown editor and formatting toolbar as comments. The toolbar provides quick formatting buttons:

- **Link** — Insert a link (`[text](url)`)
- **Bold** — `**text**`
- **Italic** — `*text*`
- **Quote** — `> text`
- **Strikethrough** — `~~text~~`
- **Spoiler** — `>!text!<`

Select text before tapping a formatting button to wrap the selection. You can also type Markdown syntax directly, including headers, lists, and code blocks. Use the **Preview** section below the editor to check your formatting before posting.

## Post Flairs

If a subreddit has post flairs available, a flair button appears next to the title field. Tap it to choose a flair from the list or select **"No Flair"** to post without one.

## Post Drafts

Hydra automatically saves your title and body text as you type. If you close the editor or leave the app, your draft is preserved and restored the next time you create a post in the same subreddit. Drafts are cleared once a post is successfully submitted.

## Editing Posts

Open one of your own text posts, tap the context menu (three dots), and select **"Edit"**. The editor opens pre-filled with your current text. Make your changes and tap **"Edit"** to save. Only the body text can be edited — titles, links, and images cannot be changed after posting. This is a Reddit restriction. Edited posts display an edited indicator.

## Deleting Posts

Open one of your own posts, tap the context menu (three dots), and select **"Delete"**. You will be asked to confirm before the post is removed.

## Troubleshooting

If you can't post, make sure you are logged in and that the subreddit allows posting. Some subreddits have account age or karma requirements. If Reddit requests a captcha, Hydra will offer to open the Reddit submission page in an in-app browser so you can complete it there.
