# Voting on Posts and Comments

Voting helps surface the best content. Upvote content you find valuable, and downvote content that doesn't contribute. A post or comment's score is the difference between its upvotes and downvotes, and influences how content is sorted.

## How to Vote

Tap the up arrow (↑) on the left side of a post or comment to upvote. The arrow turns orange and the score increases by 1. Tap the down arrow (↓) to downvote. The arrow turns blue and the score decreases by 1. Tap the same arrow again to remove your vote.

You can also vote using swipe gestures if configured in [Gestures settings](hydra://settings/general/gestures). Short and long swipes can be assigned to different actions, including upvote and downvote.

## Vote Indicators

Vote arrows appear on the left side of posts and comments by default. You can enable right-side vote indicators for comments in [Appearance settings](hydra://settings/appearance), which adds a colored border on the right edge of comments you've voted on.

## Understanding Scores

A positive score means more upvotes than downvotes, and a negative score means the opposite. Some subreddits temporarily hide comment scores after posting — hidden scores display as "-" until the time period ends. Reddit also applies score fuzzing, so displayed numbers may be approximate.

## Voting Statistics

Hydra Pro users can view voting statistics in the [Stats page](hydra://settings/stats), including total upvotes and downvotes given broken down by posts and comments, your upvote ratio, and fun facts about your voting patterns.
