# Creating Custom Themes

The Theme Maker lets you create fully custom themes with complete control over colors and appearance. You can design themes that match your personal style or create themes to share with the community.

The Theme Maker is a [Hydra Pro](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=hydra_pro) feature. Free users can try it for 5 minutes before a Pro subscription is required to save themes.

## Opening the Theme Maker

To create a new theme, go to [Theme settings](hydra://settings/theme) and tap **"Custom Theme +"**. The Theme Maker will open with your current theme's colors as a starting point.

To edit an existing custom theme, long-press a custom theme in the theme list and select **Edit**.

## Theme Settings

### Theme Name

A unique name is required to save your theme. You can change it at any time while editing.

### UI Mode

Controls whether system elements like the color picker, scroll bars, and splash screen display in **Light** or **Dark** mode.

### Status Bar

Controls whether the iOS status bar (time, battery, etc.) displays in **Light** (dark text) or **Dark** (light text) mode.

## Color Groups

The Theme Maker organizes colors into groups. Tap any color field to open the color picker and choose a new color. Colors you haven't customized will show **(default)** and use the base theme's value.

### Text Hierarchy

- **Text** — Primary text (post titles, headers)
- **Subtle Text** — Secondary text (post details, comments)
- **Very Subtle Text** — Low importance text (placeholders)

### Core Colors

- **Background** — Main screen background
- **Tint** — Popup backgrounds, text inputs, button groups, low contrast borders
- **Divider** — Dividers, high contrast borders, flairs, message bubbles

### Interactive Elements

- **Button Background** — Primary action button backgrounds
- **Button Text** — Text on primary action buttons
- **Icon/Text Button** — Text buttons without containers (e.g. navbar buttons)

### Icons

- **Primary Icon** — Main icon color
- **Secondary Icon** — Secondary icon color, switch off-state color

### Actions

- **Upvote** — Upvote button and swipe action
- **Downvote** — Downvote button and swipe action
- **Delete** — Delete button and swipe action
- **Show/Hide** — Show/hide swipe action
- **Reply** — Reply swipe action
- **Share** — Share swipe action
- **Collapse** — Collapse swipe action
- **Bookmark** — Bookmark swipe action
- **Moderator** — Moderator username color

Comment depth colors are not customizable and use a fixed color set across all themes.

## Previewing Changes

Changes apply to the app in real time, but the Theme Maker screen itself does not reflect your changes to ensure it stays usable. To preview your theme, navigate to other tabs in the app. Changes persist until you leave the Theme Maker.

## Saving Your Theme

Tap **"Save Theme"** to save your custom theme. The theme name must not be empty. If a theme with the same name already exists, you'll be asked whether to overwrite it. Saved themes are applied immediately and appear in the Custom Themes section of the theme list.

## Managing Custom Themes

### Editing a Theme

Long-press a custom theme in the theme list and select **Edit** to reopen it in the Theme Maker.

### Deleting a Theme

You can delete a custom theme by swiping it left in the theme list, or by long-pressing and selecting **Delete**. If the deleted theme is currently active, the app will switch to the default theme.

## Sharing and Importing Themes

### Sharing Your Theme

You can share custom themes by attaching them to comments or posts. When composing a reply or message, tap the **paint brush icon** in the editor toolbar, select a custom theme, and tap **Attach**. This embeds the theme data in your text. Post it to [r/HydraThemes](https://reddit.com/r/HydraThemes) or anywhere on Reddit for others to use.

### Importing a Theme

When viewing a post or comment that contains an embedded theme, Hydra automatically detects it and displays a theme preview card with the theme's name and colors. Tap the card to import the theme, with options to **Import** (save to your custom themes) or **Import & Apply** (save and apply immediately).
