# Private Messages

Private messages allow you to have direct conversations with other Reddit users. Messages are private and only visible to you and the recipient. They appear in your [Inbox](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=inbox) alongside comment and post replies.

## Messages in the Inbox

Private messages appear in the **Inbox** tab with a **mail icon**. Unread messages have a highlighted icon, while read messages have a subtle one. Each message shows the subject line, a preview of the content, the sender's name, and when it was sent.

**Tap** a message to open the full conversation. **Swipe right** to quickly mark it as read. **Long press** for the option to toggle read/unread status.

You can also mark all inbox items as read at once using the **checkmark button** in the top-right corner of the Inbox.

## Viewing Conversations

Tapping a message opens the conversation view, which shows the full message thread in chronological order. Your messages appear on the right and theirs on the left, each with the author name and timestamp.

A **Reply** button at the bottom of the conversation lets you continue the thread.

## Sending a New Message

To send a message to another user:

1. Open the user's **profile page**
2. Tap the **three-dot menu** in the top-right corner
3. Select **"Message"**
4. Enter a **title** (subject line) and write your message
5. Tap **Send**

The message editor includes a **markdown toolbar** with buttons for bold, italic, links, quotes, strikethrough, and spoiler tags. A **live preview** below the editor shows how your message will look.

Drafts are **saved automatically**, so if you close the editor before sending, your message will be there when you come back.

## Replying to Messages

To reply to a conversation:

1. **Tap** a message in your inbox to open it
2. Tap the **Reply** button at the bottom
3. Write your reply using the markdown editor
4. Tap **Send**

Reply drafts are also saved automatically.
