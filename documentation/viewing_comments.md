# Viewing Comments

## Opening Comments

Tap a post to open it, then scroll down past the post content to see comments. Comments are organized in threaded reply chains.

## Comment Structure

Comments use a threaded structure: top-level comments reply directly to the post, nested replies reply to other comments. Indentation and colored left borders show reply depth. Each thread can be collapsed or expanded.

Each comment displays author username (with badges for moderators, OP, etc.), score, time posted, flair (if enabled), awards, and edited status.

## Navigating Comment Threads

Tap a comment to collapse or expand its thread. Collapsed threads show only the top comment. Child comments remember their collapsed state when a parent thread is collapsed and re-expanded.

A floating navigation button lets you jump between top-level comments. Tap to go to the next comment, or long-press to go to the previous one. You can drag the button to reposition it on screen.

When more replies are available than what was initially loaded, tap the "load more" link at the bottom of a thread to fetch additional comments. Pull down to refresh all comments.

## Comment Sorting

Sort comments using the sort button in the top-right when viewing a post. Available options: Default, Best, New, Top, Controversial, Old, and Q&A.

Configure your default comment sort in [Sorting settings](hydra://settings/general/sorting). You can also enable per-subreddit sort memory to have the app remember your preferred sort for each subreddit.

## Comment Interactions

Vote by tapping the up or down arrow, or by using swipe gestures. Tap the same arrow again to remove your vote.

Long-press a comment for more options: collapse or collapse thread, select text, reply, save, share, and edit or delete your own comments.

## Comment Gestures

Configure swipe gestures for comments in [Gestures settings](hydra://settings/general/gestures). Each direction — short right, long right, short left, long left — can be assigned one of these actions: upvote, downvote, reply, bookmark, share, collapse, or collapse thread.

## Special Comment Types

**Stickied** comments are pinned to the top of a thread by moderators, marked with a pin icon. **Moderator** comments are highlighted in a distinct color. **OP** comments from the post author are color-coded with an "OP" badge. **AutoModerator** comments come from Reddit's automated moderation bot and are auto-collapsed by default (configurable in [Appearance settings](hydra://settings/appearance)). **Deleted/removed** comments show as "[deleted]" or "[removed]" but the thread structure remains visible.

## Comment Appearance

Customize how comments look in [Appearance settings](hydra://settings/appearance):

- **Right-side vote indicators** — moves vote arrows to the right side of comments
- **Collapse AutoModerator** — auto-collapse AutoModerator comments (on by default)
- **Show flairs** — display user flairs on comments (on by default)
- **Show comment summary (Pro)** — display an AI-generated summary at the top of long comment threads
