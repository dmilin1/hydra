# Data Use Settings

Data Use settings help you control how much data Hydra consumes by enabling low data mode. This is especially useful on cellular connections or limited data plans.

## Low Data Mode Options

Hydra provides two independent toggles in [Data Use settings](hydra://settings/dataUse):

- **Use Low Data on Wi-Fi** — Enables low data mode when connected to Wi-Fi.
- **Use Low Data on Cellular** — Enables low data mode when on a mobile network.

Hydra automatically detects your current connection type and applies the corresponding setting.

## What Low Data Mode Does

When low data mode is active, Hydra defers loading media while you scroll. Content is still fully available — it just loads on demand when you tap on it.

- **Videos** are not loaded while scrolling. A thumbnail with a "VIDEO" label is shown instead, and the video loads when you tap it.
- **Images** show thumbnails while scrolling. Tap to view the full-resolution image.
- **Link previews** do not load article preview images.
- **Subreddit icons** are not loaded.

Configure data use in [Data Use settings](hydra://settings/dataUse).
