# Split View Mode

Split View is an iPad feature that lets you view a post side-by-side with your feed. Instead of navigating away from your feed to read a post, the feed stays visible on the left while the post opens on the right.

## Enabling Split View

Split view is enabled by default on supported devices. To toggle it, go to [Appearance settings](hydra://settings/appearance) and use the **"Enable split view"** toggle. The setting only appears on devices that support split view.

When disabled, posts open in the standard full-screen view.

## Using Split View

Tap any post in your feed to open it in the right panel. The feed remains on the left, and you can scroll each panel independently. Tap a different post to switch what's shown on the right.

At the bottom of the right panel, two buttons appear:

- **Close** -- Closes the right panel and returns to the feed-only view.
- **Fullscreen** -- Opens the current post in full-screen mode.

All standard post interactions (voting, commenting, saving, sharing) work normally in split view.

## Troubleshooting

If the split view toggle doesn't appear in your settings, your device's screen may be too small to support it. Split view requires an iPad-sized screen.
