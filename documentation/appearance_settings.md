# Appearance Settings

Appearance settings control how posts, comments, and tabs are displayed. Configure them in [Appearance settings](hydra://settings/appearance). For colors and themes, see the [Themes guide](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=themes).

## Post Appearance

**Make Posts Compact**: Denser layout showing more posts at once with reduced spacing.

**Enable Split View**: iPad only. Shows posts side-by-side with the feed. Learn more in the [Split View guide](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=split_view).

**Show Subreddit at Top**: Displays the subreddit name prominently at the top of posts.

**Show Subreddit Icons**: Displays custom subreddit icons. Uses additional data.

**Post Title Max Lines**: Limits title length from 1 to 10 lines to keep post cards uniform.

**Post Text Max Lines**: Limits displayed post text from 0 to 10 lines. Set to 0 to hide text previews entirely.

**Link Description Max Lines**: Limits link preview descriptions from 0 to 30 lines. Applies to external link posts.

**Show Post Flairs**: Displays post flairs (subreddit-specific category tags).

**Blur Spoilers**: Automatically blurs spoiler-tagged content. Tap to reveal.

**Blur NSFW**: Automatically blurs NSFW content. Tap to reveal.

**Show Post Summary**: Shows AI-generated post summaries. Requires [Hydra Pro](hydra://settings/hydraPro). Learn more in the [AI Summaries guide](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=ai_summaries).

**Auto Play Videos**: Automatically plays videos as you scroll. Uses more data and battery.

**Live Text**: Enables text recognition in images using iOS Live Text, allowing you to select and copy text. Learn more in the [Live Text guide](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=live_text).

**Tap to Collapse**: When enabled, tapping on a post's media or content area in the detail view collapses it. When disabled, tapping the post content does nothing, which can be useful to avoid accidentally collapsing posts while reading. Enabled by default.

## Comment Appearance

**Right Side Vote Indicators**: Moves vote indicators to the right side of comments. Can be more comfortable for one-handed or left-handed use.

**Collapse AutoModerator**: Automatically collapses AutoModerator comments. You can still expand them manually.

**Show Comment Flairs**: Displays user flairs on comments.

**Show Comment Summary**: Shows AI-generated summaries for long comments. Requires [Hydra Pro](hydra://settings/hydraPro). Learn more in the [AI Summaries guide](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=ai_summaries).

**Tap to Collapse**: When enabled, tapping on a comment collapses or expands its thread. When disabled, tapping a comment does nothing, so you can only collapse comments via long-press or swipe gestures. Enabled by default. Existing pages may need to be refreshed for changes to take effect.

## Tab Appearance

**Show Username**: Displays your username in the bottom tab bar.

**Hide on Infinite Scroll**: Hides the tab bar while scrolling for more screen space.
