# Inbox

Your inbox is where you receive notifications about activity on your Reddit account. It shows replies to your comments, comments on your posts, and private messages from other users.

## Accessing Your Inbox

Tap the **Inbox** tab in the bottom tab bar to view your inbox. A badge on the tab shows how many unread items you have and updates automatically. The inbox refreshes when you open it, and you can pull down to manually refresh at any time. Older items load automatically as you scroll.

## Types of Inbox Items

### Replies

Replies appear when someone responds to one of your comments or posts. Each reply shows the post title, subreddit, author, reply content, vote count, and how long ago it was sent. Tapping a reply opens it in context within the full discussion.

### Private Messages

Private messages are direct messages from other users. Each message shows the subject, sender, message content, and time. Tapping a message opens the full conversation thread. Learn more in the [Private Messages guide](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=messages).

Unread items are highlighted so you can easily spot what's new.

## Interacting with Inbox Items

### Tapping

Tap any inbox item to open it. For replies, this navigates to the post or comment in context. For private messages, this opens the conversation thread. Tapping an unread item automatically marks it as read.

### Swiping

For **replies**:

- **Swipe right** to upvote (short swipe) or downvote (longer swipe)
- **Swipe left** to toggle read/unread status

For **private messages**:

- **Swipe left** to toggle read/unread status

### Long Press

Long pressing a reply gives you options to **Upvote**, **Downvote**, or **Mark as Read / Mark as Unread**. Long pressing a private message gives you the option to **Mark as Read**.

### Mark All Read

Tap the **checkmark icon** in the top-right corner of the inbox to mark all items as read at once.
