# Getting Started with Hydra

Hydra is a native iOS Reddit client for iPhone and iPad. No account or setup is required, just open the app and start browsing. Logging in with your Reddit account unlocks voting, commenting, posting, and access to your personalized content.

## Basic Navigation

Hydra uses a tab bar at the bottom with five sections: **Posts** (home feed, subreddits, multireddits), **Inbox** (messages and replies), **Account** (your profile and account management), **Search** (Reddit search), and **Settings** (app preferences).

Tap posts, comments, or subreddits to open them. Swipe right or use the back button to go back. Long press items for additional options. Configure swipe gestures for quick actions in [Gestures settings](hydra://settings/general/gestures).
