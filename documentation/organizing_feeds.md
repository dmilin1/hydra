# Organizing Your Feeds

Hydra gives you several ways to organize the subreddits you follow. The main hub for this is the **Subreddits page**, accessible from the Posts tab.

## The Subreddits Page

The Subreddits page lists all your communities, organized into sections:

- **Home** — Posts from your subscriptions.
- **Popular** — The most popular posts across Reddit.
- **All** — Posts from all subreddits.
- **Favorites** — Your favorited subreddits (if any).
- **Multireddits** — Your custom feed groups (if any).
- **Moderator** — Subreddits you moderate (if any).
- **Subscriber** — All subreddits you're subscribed to, sorted alphabetically.

An **alphabet scroller** on the right side lets you quickly jump to subreddits by letter in the Subscriber section.

## Favorites

Favorites pin your most-used subreddits to the top of the Subreddits page for quick access. You must be subscribed to a subreddit to favorite it.

To toggle a favorite, tap the **star icon** next to a subreddit on the Subreddits page, or open a subreddit, tap the **three-dots menu**, and select **Favorite** or **Unfavorite**. Favorites are stored locally on your device, per account.

## Multireddits

Multireddits are custom feeds that combine posts from multiple subreddits into one stream — useful for grouping communities by topic or interest.

Multireddits must be created on Reddit's website or another app that supports it. Once created, they appear automatically in Hydra on the Subreddits page. You can tap a multireddit to browse its combined feed, and tap the **chevron** to expand it and see which subreddits it contains.

To **add a subreddit** to a multireddit, open the subreddit, tap the **three-dots menu**, and select **Add to Multireddit**, then choose which multireddit to add it to. To **remove a subreddit**, expand the multireddit on the Subreddits page, long press the subreddit you want to remove, and select **Delete From Multireddit**.

## Subscribing and Unsubscribing

Subscribing to a subreddit adds its posts to your Home feed. To subscribe or unsubscribe, open a subreddit, tap the **three-dots menu**, and select **Subscribe** or **Unsubscribe**. You can view and manage all your subscriptions from the Subreddits page. For more details, see the [Subreddits guide](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=subreddits).

## Customizing Your Feed

Beyond organizing subreddits, you can further tailor what you see:

- **Sorting** — Choose how posts are ordered (Best, Hot, New, Top, Rising). See [Sorting](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=sorting).
- **Text Filters** — Hide posts containing specific keywords. See [Text Filters](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=text_filters).
- **Hiding Seen Posts** — Automatically filter out posts you've already viewed. See [Hiding Content](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=hiding_content).
- **Gallery Mode** — Browse media-heavy feeds in a visual layout. See [Gallery Mode](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=gallery_mode).
