# Searching Reddit

Hydra lets you search for posts, subreddits, and users across Reddit from the **Search** tab.

## Search Types

At the top of the Search page, three tabs let you switch between result types: **Posts**, **Subreddits**, and **Users**. Type your query into the search bar, and results will appear below. Tap any result to open it.

Posts and subreddits support infinite scrolling to load more results. User search is limited to a single page of results due to Reddit's limitations.

## Trending Subreddits

When you haven't entered a search query, the Search page displays a list of trending subreddits. This is a good way to discover popular communities you aren't already subscribed to.

## Searching Within a Subreddit

When browsing a subreddit, a search bar appears at the top of the post list. Typing a query there will search within that subreddit only.

Subreddit search includes sort options accessible from the header:

- **Relevance** - Most relevant results first
- **Hot** - Currently trending posts
- **New** - Most recently posted
- **Top** - Highest voted posts (with time filter: Hour, Day, Week, Month, Year, All Time)
- **Comment Count** - Most commented posts

## Quick Subreddit Search

Long-pressing the **Search** tab opens a quick search overlay. Type a subreddit name (at least 3 characters) and tap a result to jump directly to it. Tap outside the overlay to dismiss it.

## Search Operators

Reddit supports search operators that you can include in your query:

- **author:username** - Posts by a specific user
- **subreddit:name** - Posts in a specific subreddit
- **site:domain.com** - Posts linking to a specific site
- **title:text** - Search post titles only
- **selftext:text** - Search post body text only

You can also wrap phrases in quotes to search for an exact match.

## Limitations

Search finds posts, not individual comments. Deleted or removed posts will not appear in results.
