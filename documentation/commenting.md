# Writing Comments

## How to Comment

To comment on a post, open the post and tap the reply button in the action bar at the bottom. This opens the comment editor where you can write your comment and tap **"Post"** to submit.

To reply to a specific comment, long-press the comment and select **"Reply"** from the context menu, or use a swipe gesture if configured in [Gestures settings](hydra://settings/general/gestures). When replying, you can switch to the **"Parent"** tab below the editor to view the comment you're replying to.

## The Comment Editor

The comment editor includes a formatting toolbar and two tabs below the text area:

- **Parent** — Shows the comment or post you are replying to (when replying).
- **Preview** — Shows a rendered preview of your comment with formatting applied.

When editing an existing comment, the tabs are **Preview** and **Old Version** (the original text before your edits).

## Comment Drafts

Hydra automatically saves comment drafts as you type. If you close the editor or leave the app, your draft is preserved and restored the next time you reply to the same comment or post. Drafts are cleared once a comment is successfully submitted.

## Formatting

The toolbar at the bottom of the editor provides quick formatting buttons:

- **Link** — Insert a link (`[text](url)`)
- **Bold** — `**text**`
- **Italic** — `*text*`
- **Quote** — `> text`
- **Strikethrough** — `~~text~~`
- **Spoiler** — `>!text!<`

Select text before tapping a formatting button to wrap the selection. You can also type Markdown syntax directly. Use the **Preview** tab to check how your comment will look before posting.

## Editing Comments

Long-press one of your own comments and select **"Edit"** from the context menu. The editor opens pre-filled with your current text. Make your changes and tap **"Edit"** to save. Edited comments display an edited indicator that shows when the edit was made.

## Deleting Comments

Long-press one of your own comments and select **"Delete"** from the context menu. You will be asked to confirm before the comment is removed.

## Comment Actions

Long-press any comment to open the context menu with the following actions: Upvote, Downvote, Collapse, Collapse Thread, Select Text, Reply, Save, Share. **Edit** and **Delete** appear only on your own comments.

You can also perform many of these actions using swipe gestures. See [Gestures and Swipe Actions](hydra://settings/guide/?doc=gestures) for details.

## Troubleshooting

If you can't comment, make sure you are logged in and that the post is not locked. Some subreddits have account age or karma requirements for commenting.
